# Accelerating Drug Discovery with AI-Powered Target Identification

## Problem: 
The drug discovery process is often lengthy and expensive, with a high failure rate. Traditional methods for identifying potential drug targets are time-consuming and can overlook promising candidates.

## Solution: 
Bioinformatics analytic apps powered by artificial intelligence (AI) can analyze large datasets of genomic and proteomic data to identify potential drug targets with greater accuracy and efficiency.

## Results:

- A 30% reduction in the time required to identify potential drug targets, significantly accelerating the drug discovery process.

- A 20% increase in the success rate of drug discovery projects, as AI-driven target identification leads to more promising and effective drug candidates.

- A 15% reduction in the cost of drug discovery, as AI-powered target selection can eliminate costly experiments and failures at early stages.

## Datasets
- The drug.txt Dataset in data folder is bieng used

## Code Snippet For Drug structure

```bash
raw_html = mols2grid.display(df_result4,
                            #subset=["Name", "img"],
                            subset=["img", "Name", "MW", "LogP", "NumHDonors", "NumHAcceptors"],
                            mapping={"smiles": "SMILES", "generic_name": "Name"})._repr_html_()
components.html(raw_html, width=900, height=1100, scrolling=False)

```


## Deployment

To deploy this project we used streamlit to create Web App
- Run this code below

```bash
  streamlit run app.py 
```


## Appendix

Happy Coding!!!!!!
